### Primary scenario - student
Madis, who is very much interested in technology, is a 8th grade student. He likes all kinds of smart devices, especially smartphones. Madis collected some money last summer in order to buy a new and powerful smartphone. If it comes to learning and school, then going to school is usually boring for him. Quite often he plays with his phone and makes jokes in lessons instead of participating in learning activities. However, for the future he has a very clear plan to study information technology. He is not so much into animals and nature, but he is very much interested in creating learning games and adventure trails with smartphones. In about half year, a group of students from Finland is going to visit the school Madis is stuyding. Madis sees an opportunity to apply his technological know-how and voluntarily offers him as one of the creators of SmartZoos learning games. The idea of these learning games would be to spend some time together with Finnish students and learn together about nature and animals.

### Secondary scenario - student
Kaisa is a 11th grade student. She is very much interested in animals and nature. After graduating from the gymnasium she wants to study zoology or become a vet. Kaisa is one of the best students in her class who has received a number of different awards and diplomas. She is not so much into smart devices, she uses them only when it is really necessary and reasonable. Kaisa visits the zoo quite often with her younger borther and sister. She wants to bring them closer to the nature and animals as well. Kaisa sees a good option to use SmartZoos tool for creating adventure trails for her sister and brother and then go through these trails together, but also as an opportunity to collect data for her own research project.

### Secondary scenario - teacher
Silja – a natural science teacher – has spent a considerable time on teaching her students to become responsible citizens in the future. She realises that learning games with smartphones could be a good option to support her efforts, despite of the fact that she is not a proficient user of technology. She got her first smartphone 3 years ago and she has downloaded only 10 applications so far. Recently she got a tablet and as spring is coming she gets an idea to design a simple competitive game for her students using SmartZoos tool. This would give her a good opportunity to assess students knowledge and skills about what they have been learning about the natural science the whole winter semester. In that way this game would replace an usual test what she asks students to do every year in the end of the semester.
