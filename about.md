Main objective of the project is to integrate the zoos (as important parties of preserving the natural heritage) of the Central Baltic region into joint tourist attractions through developing and implementing a service package for creative adventure learning with mobile devices.

The service package consists of a set of creative multimedia tools for mobile devices along with creative and collaborative, game-based learning scenarios that engage visitors in active knowledge creation, designing and sharing knowledge objects during and after they visit to the zoo.

This tool set includes:

  * a constructor of interactive assignments tagged with QR codes;
  * augmented reality assignments;
  * quiz and puzzle creation tools;
  * video and photo story telling tool;
  * a GoogleMaps-based GPS adventure game constructor that utilises all these different types of assignments.
