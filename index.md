**SmartZoos - Cross-border services for creative adventure learning in the zoos of the Central Baltic Region**

The main objective of the SmartZoos project is to integrate the zoos of the CB region to form a joint tourist attraction through developing, implementing and joint marketing of a cross-border service package of creative adventure learning with mobile devices (SmartZoo service package).

The project activities include the service package being designed, developed, piloted among 100 visitors of the zoos and jointly marketed by the partner zoos in Estonia, Sweden and Finland. The service package will include

  * a constructor of interactive assignments tagged with QR codes;
  * augmented reality assignments;
  * quiz and puzzle creation tools;
  * a video and photo story telling tool;
  * a GoogleMaps-based GPS adventure game constructor that utilises all these different types of assignments.

The new service package attracts more visitors to the region and therefore fosters growth in economic activity and enhances development of other business activities of the region. The target values are set at 6000 more visitors in the participating zoos during the project and 50 000 more three years after the project.
The project is funded by under the specific objective of the Central Baltic program *2.1. Natural and cultural resources developed into sustainable tourist attractions, priority 2. Sustainable use of common resources.*
